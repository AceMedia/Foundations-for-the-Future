# Entrepreneurship and Economic Renewal  

The United Kingdom is facing a long-term economic crisis that goes beyond day-to-day politics. Too few entrepreneurs, too little investment in risk, and an overreliance on London have left the country dangerously unbalanced. Outside the capital, entire regions have been left behind by decades of deindustrialisation, austerity, and underinvestment.  

Britain was once a world leader in enterprise and innovation. The industrial revolution was born here, as were countless inventions from the steam engine to the World Wide Web. Yet today, the country struggles to turn talent into thriving businesses. The result is stagnation: low productivity, low wage growth, and an economy dependent on speculation and services rather than new industries and jobs.  

Entrepreneurship must not be treated as a niche pursuit. It must be placed at the centre of national renewal. Just as welfare must be understood as an investment in people, entrepreneurship must be understood as an investment in the country’s future.

## Britain has too few entrepreneurs for its size and wealth  

Compared to other advanced economies, Britain underperforms in new business creation. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2022) shows the UK behind the United States, Canada, and even smaller European nations in start-up activity. The UK’s business birth rate fell from 14% in 2017 to under 11% in 2021 (ONS, 2022), while business closures rose.  

The problem is not a lack of talent. Britain’s universities produce world-class graduates, researchers, and innovators. The problem is that the capital-owning class has become risk-averse, preferring to invest in property or overseas assets rather than home-grown enterprises. Family wealth is preserved rather than deployed. Venture capital is overwhelmingly concentrated in London and the South East, starving other regions of opportunity.  

This conservatism creates stagnation. New businesses create the majority of net new jobs. Without them, workers have fewer opportunities and wages stagnate. In the long run, this weakens social mobility and erodes trust in the system.

## London dominates the economy while regions are left behind  

Britain’s reliance on London is unhealthy. The capital accounts for over 23% of UK GDP (ONS, 2023), far higher than the share of Paris in France or Berlin in Germany. Research by *The Guardian* (2023) showed that if London were removed, the rest of the UK would be poorer per capita than Mississippi, the poorest US state.  

The consequences are visible everywhere. The North East, once a global centre of shipbuilding and heavy industry, now has some of the lowest wages and highest unemployment in the country. The Midlands, historically the engine of manufacturing, has seen entire communities hollowed out by factory closures. Coastal towns face entrenched decline as industries vanish and investment bypasses them.  

Meanwhile, London attracts talent and capital from across the world. Graduates move south to find work, reinforcing the cycle of brain drain. Housing costs soar, while regional cities struggle to grow.  

A balanced economy cannot be built on one city alone. Britain’s regions must once again become centres of enterprise in their own right.

## Austerity starved Britain of investment when it was most needed  

After the 2008 financial crisis, Britain faced a choice: borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure and renewal, or impose austerity. It chose the latter. Between 2010 and 2020, public investment as a share of GDP lagged behind most OECD countries (OECD, 2021). Local councils saw budgets cut by up to 60%, leaving them unable to support local businesses or invest in communities.  

By contrast, Germany doubled down on its *Mittelstand* model: family-owned SMEs supported by local banks, vocational training, and regional investment. These firms provided resilience, spreading wealth and employment across the country.  

Britain’s decision to cut, rather than invest, left scars. Productivity growth collapsed to its slowest rate since the 19th century. Infrastructure projects stalled. Entrepreneurs were left without the foundations — broadband, transport, regional finance — to succeed.

## Brexit compounded the problem by shrinking markets and investment  

Britain’s departure from the EU has been another blow to entrepreneurs. Membership of the single market gave British firms access to 450 million consumers with minimal barriers. Brexit erected new borders, increasing paperwork, tariffs, and uncertainty.  

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were hit hardest. A British Chambers of Commerce survey (2021) found that over 40% of SMEs trading with the EU saw falling sales and rising costs post-Brexit. For many start-ups, exporting to Europe is no longer viable.  

Financial services are also drifting away. Jobs have moved to Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam, reducing tax revenues that once funded public services. Meanwhile, foreign investors increasingly view Britain as a riskier, smaller market.  

Entrepreneurs need scale and certainty. Brexit has provided the opposite: smaller markets and more barriers.

## Britain must make entrepreneurship central to its renewal  

Britain must change course. Economic renewal depends on unleashing entrepreneurs across the country. This requires bold, practical reforms:  

- **Tax incentives for risk-taking:** Long-term capital gains relief for investments in UK start-ups, with extra incentives for those outside London.  
- **Regional venture funds:** Publicly backed funds to provide seed capital for entrepreneurs in areas neglected by private investors.  
- **Infrastructure investment:** Modern transport, 5G broadband, green energy grids, and affordable housing to support enterprise in every region.  
- **Education and skills:** A national entrepreneurship curriculum, combined with expanded apprenticeships, coding bootcamps, and business mentoring.  
- **Export support:** Grants, tax credits, and trade missions to help SMEs rebuild lost markets abroad.

## Entrepreneurship must be spread beyond London  

London cannot remain the only centre of enterprise. Regional tax breaks, enterprise zones, and incubators must be rolled out nationwide. Universities in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Glasgow could be funded as innovation hubs, linking research to industry and spin-outs.  

Public sector relocation should be expanded. The BBC’s move to Salford helped transform MediaCityUK into a creative cluster. Similar relocations — of government agencies, regulators, or national institutions — could anchor regional ecosystems.  

Britain must learn from Germany’s *Mittelstand*, where medium-sized firms are spread across the country, rooted in their communities. This provides resilience and prevents overconcentration.

## Britain must overcome its culture of risk avoidance  

Culture matters. In Britain, failure is stigmatised. In the United States, failed entrepreneurs are often respected for their experience. If Britain is to revive its entrepreneurial spirit, it must embrace risk-taking and normalise second chances.  

This requires reform of bankruptcy laws to make them less punitive, and better access to “second chance” finance for entrepreneurs who try again. Education can play a role by teaching resilience and the value of experimentation.  

Only by shifting culture can Britain move from cautious preservation of wealth to active investment in new ventures.

## Green entrepreneurship is a chance for Britain to lead  

The transition to a low-carbon economy is both a necessity and an opportunity. Britain could become a leader in green entrepreneurship, building industries in renewable energy, electric vehicles, sustainable farming, and carbon capture.  

Scotland’s offshore wind industry, Teesside’s freeport, and the West Midlands battery cluster are early signs of potential. But they require sustained support, not short-term schemes. A “Green New Deal” for Britain could create hundreds of thousands of jobs while addressing climate change.  

Countries like Denmark have shown how green investment can become a national strength. Britain should do the same, tying entrepreneurship to the industries of the future.

## Conclusion: Economic renewal depends on unleashing entrepreneurs  

Britain cannot prosper by relying on London alone, nor by clinging to old wealth and risk aversion. Renewal depends on unleashing entrepreneurs across the country — with infrastructure, finance, and cultural support to make risk-taking worthwhile.  

Entrepreneurship is not an optional extra. It is the engine of job creation, innovation, and growth. Without it, Britain faces stagnation. With it, Britain can rebuild prosperity, rebalance its regions, and reclaim its place as a nation of enterprise.
