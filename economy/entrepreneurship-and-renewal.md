# Entrepreneurship and Economic Renewal  

The United Kingdom is facing a long-term economic challenge: too few entrepreneurs, too little risk-taking, and an overreliance on London as the engine of growth. The result is a country where wealth is protected rather than invested, regions are left behind, and opportunities for ordinary people are scarce.  

Entrepreneurship must not be treated as a fringe activity or the preserve of a privileged few. It should be at the heart of national renewal. Just as welfare must be reimagined as investment in people, so too must economic policy be reimagined as investment in enterprise — in the businesses, ideas, and regions that will drive the UK forward.

## Britain has too few entrepreneurs for its size and wealth  

Compared to other advanced economies, the UK has a strikingly low rate of new business creation. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2022) found that Britain lags behind the United States, Canada, and even smaller European nations in start-up activity. This is not due to a lack of talent, but a lack of support and incentives.  

The capital-owning class has grown risk-averse, preferring to protect family wealth rather than put it to work in new ventures. Venture capital is concentrated in a few sectors, notably technology in London, while vast swathes of the economy receive little attention. The outcome is predictable: stagnant productivity, weak wage growth, and a sense of decline.  

A country of Britain’s size and history should be teeming with entrepreneurs. Instead, it is held back by systemic barriers to entry and a culture of risk avoidance.

## London dominates the economy while regions are left behind  

The UK’s economic geography is dangerously imbalanced. London accounts for a far larger share of national output than capital cities in other rich countries. Research published in *The Guardian* (2023) showed that if London were removed, the rest of the UK would have a lower income per capita than Mississippi, the poorest American state.  

This imbalance means new jobs are overwhelmingly concentrated in the capital. Graduates and skilled workers migrate to London, while regional cities struggle with brain drain and low levels of investment. Without bold action, this cycle will deepen, leaving most of the country stagnant while London overheats.

## Austerity starved Britain of investment when it was most needed  

After the 2008 financial crisis, many countries used low interest rates to borrow cheaply and invest in infrastructure, innovation, and new industries. Britain chose austerity instead. Public spending was slashed, infrastructure projects delayed, and business support withdrawn.  

At the very moment when investment could have generated growth, the UK decided to shrink. This was, in hindsight, a catastrophic error. The IMF and OECD have since both concluded that Britain’s austerity policies reduced growth and left long-term scars on productivity.  

Entrepreneurship cannot flourish in a climate of neglect. Roads, broadband, public transport, and local services are the invisible foundations that allow businesses to thrive. Without them, new ventures struggle to get off the ground.

## Brexit compounded the problem by shrinking markets and investment  

Leaving the European Union has been another blow to British enterprise. Access to the single market gave businesses the scale and certainty to grow. Cutting off that access has raised costs, reduced exports, and undermined investor confidence.  

Financial services in the City of London face an inexorable drift toward New York, Frankfurt, and Amsterdam. Manufacturing firms face tariffs and regulatory hurdles that deter expansion. For entrepreneurs outside London, the loss of seamless European trade is particularly devastating.  

Brexit was sold as a chance to “take back control,” but in practice it has made Britain a harder place to do business. Entrepreneurs thrive on access to markets; shrinking those markets is a direct attack on opportunity.

## Britain must make entrepreneurship central to its renewal  

To reverse decline, Britain needs a new strategy that makes entrepreneurship central to national renewal. This means:  

- **Tax incentives for risk-taking:** Capital gains relief for long-term investments in UK start-ups, particularly outside London.  
- **Regional venture funds:** Publicly backed funds to provide seed capital in areas long neglected by private investors.  
- **Infrastructure investment:** Roads, rail, broadband, and housing must be upgraded so businesses can operate everywhere, not just in the capital.  
- **Skills and education:** Entrepreneurship should be taught in schools and supported in universities, with mentoring and incubation programmes nationwide.  
- **Export support:** Grants and expertise for small businesses to expand abroad, rebuilding the markets lost through Brexit.

## Entrepreneurship must be spread beyond London  

New business creation cannot remain a London-only story. Regional tax breaks, incubators, and enterprise zones must be established across the North, Midlands, South West, and devolved nations. Universities outside London should be funded as innovation hubs, connecting research to industry.  

Public sector relocation can also help. Moving government departments and agencies to regional cities stimulates demand and creates ecosystems where private enterprise can follow. The BBC’s relocation to Salford is one such example; more are needed.

## Britain must overcome its culture of risk avoidance  

Finally, there is a cultural challenge. Too often in Britain, failure is stigmatised. In the United States, by contrast, failed entrepreneurs are seen as having valuable experience. If Britain is to revive its entrepreneurial spirit, we must normalise risk-taking and accept that failure is part of innovation.  

This shift can be encouraged by education, but also by reforming bankruptcy laws and access to second-chance finance. People with good ideas should not be permanently excluded after a single failure.

## Conclusion: Economic renewal depends on unleashing entrepreneurs  

Britain cannot prosper by relying on London alone, nor by clinging to the old wealth of landed families and cautious investors. Economic renewal depends on unleashing entrepreneurs across the whole country — providing them with the infrastructure, funding, and cultural support to take risks and build new businesses.  

Entrepreneurship is not a side issue. It is the engine of job creation, innovation, and growth. If Britain is to have a future, it must once again become a country where enterprise flourishes. That requires political courage, long-term investment, and a willingness to put people and ideas at the centre of national policy.
