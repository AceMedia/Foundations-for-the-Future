# Summary of Savings and Fiscal Impact

This file consolidates **headline, order‑of‑magnitude savings** implied by proposals across this repo (welfare, housing, economy, health, governance). It’s a living document: numbers are conservative placeholders where needed and should be updated as individual chapters firm up their evidence and costings.

> **Reading guide**

> - “Mechanism” = what we change.
> - “Baseline” = the problem we’re paying for today (or likely to pay for if we don’t fix it).
> - “Indicative annual saving” = cautious steady‑state estimate once reforms mature (not year one).
> - Detailed workings will live in the topic files within `budget/`.

## Headline opportunities

| Area | Mechanism | Baseline pressure (today / avoidable) | Indicative annual saving (steady state) | Linked detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Temporary accommodation & homelessness | Build/allocate more social housing; adopt Housing First; end hotel/B&B churn | Local authority temporary accommodation spend and knock‑on costs | **£0.6–£1.0bn/yr** | See **[housing-savings.md](./housing-savings.md)** |
| Housing Benefit “leakage” to high PRS rents / poor standards | Shift spend from subsidies to new social stock; enforce Decent Homes in PRS | Large, recurring HB/UC outlay to private landlords, incl. non‑decent stock | **£1.0–£2.0bn/yr** | See **[housing-savings.md](./housing-savings.md)** |
| Building safety failures (future liabilities) | “Do it right first time”: non‑combustible materials; inspections; accountability | Historic cladding/remediation bills in the multi‑£bn range | **£0.3–£0.6bn/yr** (avoided) | See **[housing-savings.md](./housing-savings.md)** |
| Poor housing → health costs | Minimum standards + targeted retrofit (insulation, damp/mould fixes, ventilation) | Significant, recurring NHS burden from cold/damp/unsafe homes | **£0.3–£0.6bn/yr** | See **[health-savings.md](./health-savings.md)** |
| Welfare admin & crisis-churn | Replace sanctions churn with stable support; bulk food procurement; simplify admin | Admin overheads, crisis interventions, and inefficiencies | **£0.2–£0.5bn/yr** | See **[welfare-savings.md](./welfare-savings.md)** |
| Loneliness/productivity drag | Well‑being budgets; community participation; design for social connection | Employer productivity losses from loneliness/social isolation | **£0.2–£0.4bn/yr** (economy‑wide) | See **[welfare-savings.md](./welfare-savings.md)** |
| Planning delays & under‑supply | Faster planning; design codes; mid‑rise where appropriate | Lost output from constrained housing near jobs | **TBD** (material) | Will link to economy/housing chapters |

> **Directional takeaway:** Even before dynamic growth effects, a prudent bundle of reforms points to **~£2.4–£4.6bn per year** in steady‑state, *direct* savings/avoided costs — driven mainly by (1) shifting HB toward bricks‑and‑mortar social stock, (2) cutting the temporary‑accommodation bill, (3) preventing another cladding‑scale remediation cycle, and (4) lowering NHS costs from poor housing.

## Narrative rationale (in brief)

1. **Build the right homes and stop paying for hotels.**  
   Social housing + Housing First replaces costly, unstable temporary accommodation with secure tenancies and support. International evidence shows large per‑person savings once people are stably housed.

2. **Stop subsidising poor‑quality private rents.**  
   As new social stock comes online and PRS standards rise, reliance on Housing Benefit to prop up expensive/non‑decent rentals falls. Savings accrue gradually but persist.

3. **Avoid the next cladding bill.**  
   Tight materials rules, independent inspections, and developer liability prevent multi‑billion‑pound remediation waves a decade from now.

4. **Healthy homes save the NHS.**  
   Damp, cold, and unsafe homes drive respiratory, cardiovascular, and injury costs. Minimum standards plus targeted retrofit reduce a recurring burden.

5. **Well‑being is fiscally sensible.**  
   Loneliness and social isolation drag on productivity. Modest, smart spend to connect people (and better place‑making) returns a slice of that as higher output/tax receipts.

## How this can translate into tax relief

If ministers hypothecate a portion of realised savings (say **£2–3bn/yr** after reforms scale), options include:

- **First‑time buyer reliefs** outside London (e.g. stamp duty thresholds) while ring‑fencing capital budgets for housebuilding.  
- **Lower business rates multipliers** for SMEs in designated regeneration zones.  
- **Council tax offsets** where homelessness pressures fall because temporary accommodation use collapses.

Exact choices belong in a full scorecard. As each `budget/*-savings.md` fills out, we’ll publish an integrated **Budget Appendix** with options and distributional impacts.

## Next actions

- Draft **[housing-savings.md](./housing-savings.md)** with: HB modelling; TA cost curves; retrofit ROI and safety‑failure avoidance.  
- Draft **[welfare-savings.md](./welfare-savings.md)** with: admin simplification; bulk procurement economies; sanction‑system costs vs outcomes.  
- Draft **[health-savings.md](./health-savings.md)** with: NHS cost attribution and savings from housing/food/well‑being reforms.  
- Populate **[governance-and-admin-savings.md](./governance-and-admin-savings.md)** (duplicate agency consolidation; digital service efficiencies).  
- Quantify dynamic growth effects once the **Economy** chapter expands (regional entrepreneurship, exports).
