# Summary of Savings and Fiscal Impact

This file consolidates **headline, order‑of‑magnitude savings** implied by proposals across this repo (welfare, housing, economy, health, education, governance). It’s a living document: numbers are conservative placeholders where needed and will be updated as individual chapters firm up evidence and costings.

> **Reading guide**  
> - “Mechanism” = what we change.  
> - “Baseline” = the problem we’re paying for today (or likely to pay for if we don’t fix it).  
> - “Indicative annual saving” = cautious steady‑state estimate once reforms mature (not year one).  
> - Detailed workings live in the topic files within `budget/`.

| **Planning delays & housing under‑supply** | Speed up planning; enable mid‑rise development where appropriate            | Lost economic output from housing shortfall (*e.g.* 70k delayed homes ≈ **£1.9 billion/yr** GVA lost | **TBD** *(likely multi‑£billion/yr)*       | See housing/economy chapters                 |

> **Directional takeaway:** Even before any dynamic growth effects, this reform package yields on the order of **£3–6 billion per year** in steady‑state *direct* savings or cost avoidances. The bulk comes from **housing reforms** – redirecting Housing Benefit into new social homes, cutting the £1.6 billion temporary accommodation bill, and preventing another £5 billion cladding‑type debacle – alongside **NHS savings** from healthier homes and diets. On top of that, streamlining government and investing in people’s well-being (skills, community, digital services) can each return on the order of a billion-plus annually over time.

## How this can translate into tax relief

If ministers choose to reinvest a portion of the savings (say **~£3 billion/yr** once reforms fully scale), possible tax relief measures include:

- **First‑time buyer relief** – e.g. raising stamp duty thresholds outside London – paired with continued investment in new housebuilding.  
- **Lower business rates** for SMEs in new enterprise zones to spur regional growth.  
- **Council tax offsets** in areas where homelessness pressures drop sharply as the temporary accommodation burden disappears.

The exact mix would be decided in a full Budget process. As each `budget/*-savings.md` file is fleshed out with data, we will publish a consolidated **Budget Appendix** detailing options and distributional impacts.

## Next actions

- **[Housing-savings.md](./housing-savings.md)** – Refine with local authority case studies (temporary accommodation costs), Housing Benefit reallocation models, retrofit ROI analysis, and building safety risk projections.  
- **[Welfare-savings.md](./welfare-savings.md)** – Quantify administrative cost reductions (DWP processing, tribunals) and savings from bulk purchasing of essentials; analyze sanction vs. support outcomes.  
- **[Health-savings.md](./health-savings.md)** – Incorporate NHS data on costs of poor housing and diet-related illness; strengthen the case for preventive interventions (retrofit, nutrition) with ROI figures.  
- **[Governance-and-admin-savings.md](./governance-and-admin-savings.md)** – Add examples of agency mergers and digital service rollouts (e.g. lessons from Estonia’s e-government) to estimate efficiency gains.  
- **[Education-and-skills-savings.md](./education-and-skills-savings.md)** – Integrate Treasury data on NEET costs; model long-term tax revenue gains from upskilling the workforce.  
- Continue to quantify **dynamic growth effects** (entrepreneurship, regional development, etc.) as the **Economy** chapter expands.
