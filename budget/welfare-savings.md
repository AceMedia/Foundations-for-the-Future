# Welfare and Well-being Savings

This file captures **efficiency gains and avoided costs** within the welfare system and wider well-being agenda. The emphasis is on reforms that improve outcomes while cutting churn, duplication, and hidden fiscal drag.

## Key mechanisms

- **Admin simplification**  
  Streamline assessment/sanctions, cut appeals overhead.  
  ↳ See: [`../welfare/welfare-and-wellbeing-reform.md`](../welfare/welfare-and-wellbeing-reform.md)

- **Stable support vs sanctions churn**  
  Evidence suggests Housing First / steady benefit models reduce crisis costs.

- **Bulk procurement & distribution**  
  Community-scale food programmes can lower cost vs emergency/crisis spend.  
  ↳ See: [`../economy/community-and-social-enterprise.md`](../economy/community-and-social-enterprise.md)

- **Loneliness/productivity impact**  
  Well-being initiatives reduce isolation → improved productivity/tax base.
