# Governance and Administrative Savings

Focus: **back-office efficiency and duplication reduction** across government and agencies.

## Key mechanisms

- **Agency consolidation**  
  Merge overlapping quangos and back-office units.  
  ↳ See: [`../governance/governance-reform.md`](../governance/governance-reform.md)

- **Digital transformation**  
  Automate transactional services → lower admin headcount.  
  ↳ See: [`../economy/digital-and-innovation.md`](../economy/digital-and-innovation.md)

- **Smarter procurement**  
  Centralised frameworks, bulk buying.
