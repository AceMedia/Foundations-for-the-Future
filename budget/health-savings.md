# Health Savings

This file outlines how upstream reforms (housing, welfare, diet, community) reduce **downstream NHS and social care costs**.

---

## Key mechanisms

- **Housing quality → health outcomes**  
  Cold/damp housing drives respiratory/cardiovascular costs.  
  ↳ See: [`../housing/housing-policy.md`](../housing/housing-policy.md)

- **Nutrition & food access**  
  Community procurement improves diets, lowers obesity/diabetes spend.  
  ↳ See: [`../economy/community-and-social-enterprise.md`](../economy/community-and-social-enterprise.md)

- **Well-being & social connection**  
  Reduces mental health burden and isolation costs.  
  ↳ See: [`../welfare/welfare-and-wellbeing-reform.md`](../welfare/welfare-and-wellbeing-reform.md)
