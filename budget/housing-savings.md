# Housing Savings

This file collects **housing-related fiscal savings and avoided liabilities**. It links closely with the Housing and Economy sections.

## Key mechanisms

- **End hotel/B&B temporary accommodation** – Replace with secure social housing (Housing First).  
  ↳ See: [`../housing/housing-policy.md`](../housing/housing-policy.md)

- **Shift Housing Benefit leakage** – Move spend from PRS subsidies into bricks-and-mortar social stock.

- **Prevent safety failures** – Enforce strong standards to avoid future cladding-style bills.  
  ↳ See: [`../housing/building-standards.md`](../housing/building-standards.md)

- **Healthy homes → NHS savings** – Retrofit damp/cold homes to cut NHS costs.  
  ↳ See: [`../health/public-health-and-prevention.md`](../health/public-health-and-prevention.md)
