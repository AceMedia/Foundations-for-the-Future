# Housing Savings

This file collects **housing-related fiscal savings and avoided liabilities**. It links closely with the Housing and Economy sections.

## Key mechanisms

- **End hotel/B&B temporary accommodation** – Replace with secure social housing (Housing First).  
  ↳ See: [`../housing/housing-policy.md`](../housing/housing-policy.md)

- **Shift Housing Benefit leakage** – Move spend from PRS subsidies into bricks-and-mortar social stock.

- **Prevent safety failures** – Enforce strong standards to avoid future cladding-style bills.  
  ↳ See: [`../housing/building-standards.md`](../housing/building-standards.md)

- **Healthy homes → NHS savings** – Retrofit damp/cold homes to cut NHS costs.  
  ↳ See: [`../health/public-health-and-prevention.md`](../health/public-health-and-prevention.md)

## Indicative saving categories

| Mechanism                    | Baseline pressure          | Potential saving       | Linked detail    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Temporary accommodation      | **£1.6 billion/yr** (LA spend):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} | £0.6–£1.0 billion/yr  | Housing policy   |
| HB leakage to PRS            | Multi-£bn annually         | £1.0–£2.0 billion/yr  | Housing policy   |
| Safety failures (cladding etc.) | £5 billion+ historic bill | £0.3–£0.6 billion/yr *(avoided)* | Building standards |
| Poor housing health costs    | NHS burden *(~£1.4 billion/yr)* | £0.3–£0.6 billion/yr  | Health (see **[health-savings.md](./health-savings.md)**) |

## Narrative Rationale for Housing Reform

1. **Build the right homes and stop paying for hotels.**  
   Social housing and Housing First initiatives replace costly, unstable temporary accommodation with secure homes and support. Evidence shows large savings once people are stably housed instead of cycling through emergency shelters.

2. **Stop subsidising poor‑quality private rents.**  
   As new social housing comes online and private rentals are held to higher standards, reliance on Housing Benefit to prop up expensive or non‑decent rentals falls. The taxpayer stops effectively overpaying for subpar housing.

3. **Avoid the next cladding bill.**  
   Strict rules on building materials, independent inspections, and real developer liability aim to prevent another multi‑billion-pound safety crisis a decade from now. It’s cheaper to build safe than to fund massive remediation later.

4. **Healthy homes and diets save NHS money.**  
   Cold, damp, and unsafe homes drive recurring costs for the NHS (respiratory illness, injuries, mental health). Similarly, poor nutrition fuels obesity and diabetes costs. Raising housing standards, retrofitting old homes, and improving diets reduce these burdens over time.

5. **Well‑being and community pay off fiscally.**  
   Loneliness and social isolation act as an economic drag and a public health risk. Modest investments to foster community connection and personal development pay back via a healthier, more productive society – yielding higher tax receipts and lower welfare and health expenditures.
