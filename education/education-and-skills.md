# Education and Skills for a Changing World

Education in Britain is too focused on exams and too little on practical skills.

## Skills for the Future
We need a system that matches education to jobs. Coding, engineering, health sciences, and green technology must be central. Germany’s apprenticeship model demonstrates how vocational and academic routes can be equally respected.

## Parents, Not Government, First
Children’s online safety is first and foremost an at-home issue. Parents must be empowered to set boundaries and educated on digital risks. The government should provide tools and resources, but not act as a digital nanny. Family responsibility cannot be legislated away.
