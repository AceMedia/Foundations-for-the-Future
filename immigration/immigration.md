# Immigration and Border Policy: A Practical Framework for Managing Migration

Immigration policy in the United Kingdom has become a political football, swinging between unworkable extremes of rhetoric without addressing the underlying realities. The Channel crossing crisis symbolises this failure: thousands of people continue to risk their lives in dangerous conditions while the government cycles through expensive but ineffective deterrent measures. Meanwhile, legitimate economic and humanitarian needs go unmet.

A realistic approach must recognise that migration is driven by powerful economic and political forces that cannot be wished away through soundbites or symbolic gestures. The evidence from comparable countries shows that effective migration policy requires a balanced package: expanding safe, legal routes; processing asylum claims quickly and fairly; disrupting criminal smuggling networks; and removing the incentives that drive dangerous journeys.

## The scale of the challenge and what drives it

Channel crossings rose from fewer than 300 people in 2018 to over 45,000 in 2022, remaining high through 2024-25 (Home Office, 2024). Most arrivals come from a relatively small set of countries experiencing conflict or economic collapse: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Albania consistently feature in the top nationalities.

These are not random population movements. They follow established routes controlled by organised criminal networks that profit from human desperation. The Migration Observatory (2023) found that smuggling prices range from £3,000 to £8,000 per person, generating estimated revenues of over £150 million annually for criminal enterprises.

The current system fails everyone. Asylum seekers endure dangerous journeys and years of uncertainty. Taxpayers fund expensive hotel accommodation that reached £2.4 billion in 2022-23 (NAO, 2023). Local communities see services strained without adequate central government support. Meanwhile, legitimate refugees who might qualify for protection remain trapped in camps or dangerous situations abroad.

## Learning from international approaches that work

Countries that have reduced dangerous migration typically combine expanded legal routes with effective enforcement against smugglers and fair but rapid processing of claims.

**Australia's approach** combined offshore processing with expanded humanitarian resettlement quotas. While controversial, boat arrivals fell from over 20,000 in 2013 to near zero by 2015. However, the human rights costs were significant, and the model required expensive third-country arrangements (Refugee Council of Australia, 2023).

**Canada's private sponsorship model** allows community groups to directly sponsor refugees, creating integration support while expanding resettlement capacity. Over 300,000 refugees have been resettled through this route since 1979, with better employment and integration outcomes than government-assisted refugees (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 2023).

**Germany's approach to Syrian refugees** shows the importance of processing speed. In 2015-16, Germany processed over one million asylum claims while maintaining legal standards. Key factors included massive investment in decision-making capacity, clear criteria, and strong integration programmes (BAMF, 2022).

**France and Italy's experience** demonstrates the limits of purely enforcement-focused approaches. Despite extensive border controls and bilateral agreements, crossings have largely shifted routes rather than eliminated them (European Council on Refugees and Exiles, 2023).

## A practical policy framework: four pillars working together

### 1. Expand safe, legal routes and scale them quickly

The UK's resettlement programme remains tiny by international standards: just 1,171 people were resettled in 2022, compared to over 20,000 in Canada (UNHCR, 2023). Legal migration routes for work remain complex and expensive, pushing employers toward irregular arrangements.

**Immediate actions:**
- Triple the humanitarian resettlement quota to 5,000 annually, prioritising vulnerable cases from regions generating Channel crossings
- Launch community sponsorship programmes allowing local groups to support refugee integration
- Create fast-track skilled worker visas for shortage occupations, reducing incentives for irregular work
- Expand family reunion criteria to match European standards

**Why this works:** When Canada increased resettlement quotas, irregular arrivals at the US border decreased. When Australia expanded skilled migration, temporary overstays fell (Migration Policy Institute, 2022).

### 2. Process asylum claims within months, not years

The UK's asylum backlog reached 175,000 cases by late 2023, with average waiting times over two years (Home Office, 2024). This creates massive costs while leaving people in limbo. Fast, fair decisions reduce both taxpayer expense and human suffering.

**Immediate actions:**
- Recruit 1,000 additional caseworkers and immigration judges
- Set statutory targets: initial decision within six months, appeals within three months
- Invest in digital case management and video hearings to increase capacity
- Create fast-track processes for claims from countries with high grant rates

**Budget impact:** Each person removed from hotel accommodation saves approximately £150 per day. Processing 50,000 cases faster could save over £500 million annually (NAO, 2023).

### 3. Target smuggling networks, not desperate people

Current enforcement focuses disproportionately on prosecuting migrants themselves rather than the criminal enterprises that exploit them. Effective disruption requires intelligence-led operations targeting organisers, not victims.

**Immediate actions:**
- Establish joint intelligence unit with French authorities to map smuggling networks
- Introduce unexplained wealth orders for suspected smuggling assets
- Focus prosecutions on facilitators and organisers, not migrants
- Expand maritime cooperation with French coastguard for interdiction before departure

**Evidence base:** The NCA's Operation Symbolical disrupted several major smuggling networks in 2022-23, leading to temporary reductions in crossings. Sustained pressure on organisers is more effective than prosecuting migrants (National Crime Agency, 2023).

### 4. Remove incentives for irregular work through smart enforcement

If people can easily find illegal work, they will keep coming illegally. The solution is targeting bad employers, not creating more bureaucracy for everyone else.

Illegal employment remains a key pull factor. Over 60% of asylum seekers eventually work in the grey economy while awaiting decisions. Smart enforcement targets exploitative employers while protecting workers.

**Immediate actions:**
- Strengthen voluntary digital verification systems for migrant work authorisation only
- Increase employer fines to £50,000 per illegal worker for serious offences
- Protect migrant workers who report exploitation from immigration enforcement
- Create seasonal worker visas for agriculture and hospitality sectors, supporting the [bulk food procurement systems outlined in welfare reform](../welfare/welfare-and-wellbeing-reform.md) and contributing to regional economic renewal during peak farming and tourism seasons (see [detailed seasonal migration framework](./seasonal-migration.md))

The Netherlands reduced illegal employment by 30% between 2018-2022 by focusing enforcement on exploitative employers rather than expanding checks on legal workers.

## Implementation principles and political realities

**Speed and fairness must work together.** Fast decisions save money and reduce uncertainty, but rushed processes create legal vulnerabilities. Germany's investment in training and technology shows both are achievable (BAMF, 2022).

**Deterrence works only when combined with alternatives.** Australia's offshore model reduced boat arrivals but required expensive third-country arrangements and caused significant human rights concerns. Deterrence without legal routes simply displaces suffering.

**Public support requires transparency and local investment.** Successful integration requires community buy-in. The Syrian resettlement programme worked because it was voluntary, well-funded, and transparent about numbers and locations (British Red Cross, 2022).

**International cooperation is essential but requires compromise.** The UK cannot solve Channel crossings alone. French cooperation requires sustained diplomacy, intelligence sharing, and sometimes accepting responsibility for processing claims that might otherwise be rejected.

## Budget impact and economic effects

The current system's failures are expensive. Hotel accommodation costs £2.4 billion annually. Processing delays cost an estimated £500 per case per month in administrative overhead. Failed removals often require multiple attempts, each costing thousands of pounds (NAO, 2023).

A reformed system could save £1-2 billion annually through:
- Reduced hotel costs from faster processing: £800 million - £1.2 billion
- Lower administrative overhead from streamlined procedures: £200-300 million  
- Reduced enforcement costs from targeting smugglers not migrants: £100-200 million
- Economic benefits from expanded legal migration: potentially £500 million+ in additional tax revenue

**Investment required:** Expanding processing capacity requires upfront spending of approximately £200-300 million annually. Expanding resettlement and legal routes costs £100-200 million. The net saving remains substantial.

## What success looks like: measurable outcomes

Effective immigration policy produces measurable results within 2-3 years:
- Channel crossings fall by 60-80% as legal routes expand and processing speeds up
- Asylum backlog eliminated within 24 months through increased capacity
- Integration outcomes improve through community sponsorship and targeted support
- Public confidence in the system increases through transparency and fair enforcement

**Countries achieving these outcomes** include Canada (high resettlement, public support), Australia (reduced irregular arrivals), and Germany (rapid processing at scale).

## Political sustainability and public confidence

Immigration policy fails when it promises quick fixes to complex problems. The Rwanda scheme consumed hundreds of millions of pounds while removing fewer than 10 people (Home Office, 2024). Symbolic measures satisfy neither humanitarian concerns nor public demands for effective control.

Sustainable policy requires honest communication about trade-offs. Expanding legal routes may initially increase numbers, but reduces dangerous journeys and improves integration. Fast processing may grant protection to more people, but eliminates the expensive limbo of prolonged uncertainty.

The political reward comes from demonstrable results: fewer dangerous crossings, lower costs, better integration, and restored confidence that the system works fairly and effectively. This requires patience and consistency rather than policy lurches driven by daily headlines.

## Conclusion: Beyond performance politics to practical solutions

Immigration challenges cannot be solved through rhetoric or symbolic gestures. They require sustained investment in processing capacity, diplomatic cooperation, and balanced policies that address both humanitarian obligations and public concerns about fairness and control.

The evidence from comparable countries shows that a mixed approach works: expand legal routes, process claims quickly and fairly, target criminal networks, and remove incentives for irregular migration. This is neither "open borders" nor "fortress Britain" — it is practical policy that prioritises human dignity while maintaining public support.

The UK has the resources and expertise to implement such a system. What it needs is the political will to choose evidence over ideology and long-term solutions over short-term headlines.
