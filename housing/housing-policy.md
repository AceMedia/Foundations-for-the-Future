# Housing Policy and Secure Living

The UK’s housing market is broken. Demand vastly outstrips supply, rent consumes the majority of wages, and home ownership is out of reach for most under 40.

## Using Land and Systems We Already Have
The solution is not endless taxpayer-funded schemes. It is about smarter use of existing public land and compulsory purchase of long-term derelict properties. Councils can partner with housing associations and builders to deliver affordable units at scale without endless central bureaucracy.

## Welfare and Rent
People on benefits must be supported directly with housing and essential bills. That means reducing the “cash handout” element while ensuring rent, heat, and light are secured. This leaves people with more free money to spend on living, not surviving — improving quality of life while lowering the government’s overall admin costs.

## Well-being Before Monopoly
The obsession with saving every building, every high street, and every landlord is unhealthy. A functioning housing system must focus on secure homes and stable rents, not speculative profits. Examples from Vienna’s social housing model show this works: long-term leases, capped rents, and quality stock.
