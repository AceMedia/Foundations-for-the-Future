# The NHS and Public Health

The NHS is both a national treasure and a system at breaking point.

## Treating Health, Not Criminality
Drug misuse is not a criminal issue but a health issue. Portugal has shown that decriminalisation coupled with strong public health support reduces harm, crime, and costs. Cannabis is already legal in Canada and across many US states with clear evidence of medical and tax benefits. The UK should follow suit: regulated, taxed, and safe.

## Bulk Food Provision
We can reduce NHS demand through better nutrition. Government already purchases food in bulk for schools, prisons, and hospitals. Extending this to a universal baseline for all — free or subsidised healthy meals delivered locally — would cut obesity, diabetes, and long-term costs dramatically.

## Well-being, Not Over-Control
Moderate drinking and smoking in adulthood is not the government’s business. Health advice should remain strong, but fun and freedom are part of life. Public health succeeds when it educates, not when it controls.
