# Democracy and Governance Reform

British democracy needs refreshing to work for the modern era.

## Freedom of Speech as a Core Principle
Insults and offence are civil matters, not criminal. Free speech is the cornerstone of any democracy. Attempts to criminalise upsetting language weaken trust in law and distract from real threats. Strong civil routes for redress (defamation, harassment) already exist.

## Local Decision-Making
Too much power rests in Westminster. Regional assemblies, mayors, and councils should have more authority to invest and govern locally. This reduces waste, increases accountability, and restores trust.

## Cutting Bureaucracy and Cost
Government must save money by simplifying services. Fewer overlapping agencies, clearer responsibilities, and stronger digital systems. Estoniaâ€™s digital governance is a world leader, cutting costs while empowering citizens.
