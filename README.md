**Practical ideas for fixing the UK — one foundation at a time.**

## About  

*Foundations for the Future* is a collection of essays and policy chapters written in Markdown.  
It explores how the UK could rethink welfare, well-being, and economic renewal in order to build a fairer, healthier, and more resilient society.  

This project is not a finished manifesto. It is a **living document**, a working draft intended for discussion and iteration. By putting these ideas in the open, the aim is to invite constructive feedback, critique, and collaboration.
