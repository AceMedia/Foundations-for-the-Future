# Foundations for the Future  

**Practical ideas for fixing the UK — one foundation at a time.**  

---

## The Big Picture

Britain faces interconnected crises: unaffordable housing, broken welfare, stagnant regions, dangerous Channel crossings, and an NHS under pressure. This isn't about left vs right — it's about what works.

*Foundations for the Future* is an evidence-based policy framework showing how Britain can build prosperity, security, and dignity for everyone. Every proposal is backed by international examples, detailed costings, and a clear implementation plan.

This is a **living document** — a working draft for discussion, not a finished manifesto.

## What We're Proposing

### **🏠 Housing: Guaranteed Homes, Not Landlord Subsidies**
Stop spending £23 billion/year on Housing Benefit that flows to private landlords. Build council housing instead. Give people secure homes, cut homelessness costs (£1.6 billion/year on temporary accommodation), and prevent the next cladding scandal.
→ *[Read the housing policy](housing/housing-policy.md)*

### **💷 Welfare: Investment in People, Not Crisis Management**  
Replace cash-and-hope with direct provision: guaranteed housing, bulk food procurement, covered utilities, and well-being budgets for dignity and growth. Countries like Finland show this works better and costs less.
→ *[Read the welfare reform](welfare/welfare-and-wellbeing-reform.md)*  
→ *[Read about bulk food procurement systems](welfare/bulk-food-procurement.md)*

### **🚢 Immigration: Legal Routes, Fast Decisions, Smart Enforcement**
End the Channel crossing crisis with four simple principles: expand safe, legal routes; process asylum claims in months not years; target smuggling networks; remove incentives for illegal work. Australia, Canada, and Germany show this approach works.
→ *[Read the immigration framework](immigration/immigration.md)*  
→ *[Read about seasonal worker programmes](immigration/seasonal-migration.md)*

### **🏭 Economy: Entrepreneurs Everywhere, Not Just London**
Britain has too few entrepreneurs and too much London dependence. Create regional venture funds, infrastructure investment, tax incentives for risk-taking, and green entrepreneurship to spread prosperity nationwide.
→ *[Read the economic renewal plan](economy/entrepreneurship-and-renewal.md)*

### **🩺 Health: Prevention, Not Just Treatment**
Treat drugs as a health issue (like Portugal), expand bulk healthy food provision, and stop trying to control what adults do in their spare time. Focus NHS resources on care, not policing lifestyle choices.
→ *[Read the health policy](health/nhs-and-public-health.md)*

### **🎓 Education: Skills for Jobs, Parents for Children**
Match education to real jobs — coding, engineering, green technology. Follow Germany's apprenticeship model. Keep parents responsible for children's online safety, not government as digital nanny.
→ *[Read the education framework](education/education-and-skills.md)*

### **🗳️ Governance: Local Power, Digital Efficiency, Free Speech**
Move power from Westminster to regions. Merge overlapping agencies, digitise services (learn from Estonia), and protect free speech by making insults civil matters, not criminal ones.
→ *[Read the democracy reforms](governance/democracy-and-reform.md)*

## The Numbers: £3-6 Billion in Annual Savings

These reforms don't cost money — they save it:

- **Housing**: £1-2 billion/year from redirecting Housing Benefit into social housing and ending costly temporary accommodation
- **Health**: £0.5-1 billion/year from healthier homes and better nutrition preventing NHS demand  
- **Welfare**: £0.2-0.5 billion/year from ending bureaucratic churn and crisis interventions
- **Skills**: £0.8-1.5 billion/year from reducing NEETs and boosting productivity
- **Government**: £0.6-1.2 billion/year from merging agencies and digital transformation

**Total: £3-6 billion annually in direct savings, before counting dynamic growth effects.**

## Why This Matters

Britain isn't broken beyond repair. We've done bold reform before — the post-war welfare state, council housing, the NHS. We can do it again.

But we need to be honest about trade-offs and learn from what works elsewhere. That means Vienna's social housing, Canada's refugee sponsorship, Germany's skills training, Portugal's drug policy, and Estonia's digital government.

This framework shows those lessons can work in Britain too.
